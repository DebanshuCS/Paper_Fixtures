Abstract 
Numerous public opinion polls reveal that individuals are quite concerned about threats to their 
information privacy However, the current understanding of privacy that emerges is fragmented 
and usually discipline-dependent A systematic understanding of individuals’ privacy concerns is 
of increasing importance as information technologies increasingly expand the ability for 
organizations to store, process, and exploit personal data Drawing on information boundary 
theory, we developed an integrative model suggesting that privacy concerns form because of an 
individual’s disposition to privacy or situational cues that enable one person to assess the 
consequences of information disclosure Furthermore, a cognitive process, comprising perceived  
privacy risk, privacy control and privacy intrusion is proposed to shape an individual’s privacy 
concerns toward a specific Web site’s privacy practices We empirically tested the research model 
through a survey  that was administered to users of four different types of web sites: 
electronic commerce sites,  social networking sites,  financial sites, and  healthcare sites 
The study reported here is novel to the extent that existing empirical research has not examined 
this complex set of privacy issues Implications for theory and practice are discussed, and 
suggestions for future research along the directions of this study are provided

Introduction 
The importance of privacy in the contemporary globalized, information societies has been widely discussed and is 
by now undisputed Numerous works in diverse fields have immensely improved our understanding of privacy at the 
individual, organizational and societal levels However, the picture of privacy that emerges is fragmented and 
usually discipline-dependent The definitions of privacy vary significantly in different fields, ranging from a right or 
entitlement in law , to a state of limited access or isolation in philosophy and 
psychology , and to control in social sciences and information systems  The wide scope of scholarly interests has resulted in a variety of conceptualizations of privacy, which leads 
Solove  to note that “rivacy as a concept is in disarray Nobody can articulate what it means”  
Privacy has been described as multidimensional, elastic, depending upon context, and dynamic in the sense that it 
varies with life experience   
Over the past decade, scholars in information systems have examined privacy issues  related to the collection and use of personal information from a variety of 
perspectives A general observation from this stream of research is that privacy researchers have often used the 
construct of privacy concerns as the proxy to define and measure the concept of privacy Accordingly, the construct 
of privacy concerns has usually been included and empirically validated as an important factor in various behavioral 
models   
Little is known, however, on how privacy concerns are formed and developed, and what individual, cultural, 
institutional, and environmental factors mitigate or influence them in a systematic manner In general, in complex 
nomological behavioral models, the construct of privacy concerns has been treated as a psychologically unitary, 
stand-alone concept  Thus, understanding the nature and formation of privacy concerns, as 
well as their predictors, is a major issue for researchers and practitioners Yet, no comprehensive model has been 
developed in the extant literature to conceptually explore the formation process of privacy concerns as well as to 
differentiate privacy concerns from other overlapping cognate concepts such as intrusion, privacy risk, privacy 
control, privacy assurance, and disposition to value privacy We seek to address this gap in the literature by 
developing a literature-grounded model that highlights the interrelated factors that contribute to the formation of 
privacy concerns By rigorously identifying antecedents of privacy concerns, and by testing our model in different 
contexts of Internet usage, we are able to conceptually clarify the multiple dimensions of privacy concerns 
Theory 
The research model is depicted in     The model implies that privacy concerns form because of an individual’s 
disposition to value privacy or situational cues that enable one person to assess the consequences of information 
disclosure A cognitive process, comprising privacy risk, privacy control and privacy intrusion is proposed to shape 
an individual’s perception of a specific Web site’s privacy practices    
Information Boundary Theory  
The overarching theory that guides the development of the research model is the Information Boundary Theory 
, which formulates the social aspects of information disclosure IBT posits that each individual forms a 
physical or virtual informational space around her with clearly defined boundaries Depending on the situational and 
personal conditions, an attempt by an external entity to penetrate these boundaries may be perceived by the 
individual as intrusion The motivation to reveal or withhold information is governed by “boundary opening” and 
“boundary closure” rules  These rules involve dynamic psychological processes that are affected 
by the nature of the relationship, the expected use of the disclosed information, and the benefits of disclosing the 
information  Thus, it is important to note that the rules emerge from an individual’s articulation of 
a personal “calculus” of boundary negotiation which is influenced by the conditions in which disclosure is deemed 
acceptable or unacceptable The conditions “depend in part upon the status of the relationship between the sender 
and the audience  receiving it” ; thus they are context 
specific  
IBT has been applied in employee privacy research   which provided a reasonable 
foundation for understanding privacy management in IT intensive organizations The concept of information

boundary in the information privacy context means that: First, each individual constructs a personal informational 
space with her own defined boundaries Second, the boundary of this information space depends on the nature of the 
information and the individual’s own personality and environmental characteristics Third, when the individual 
detects a request for information disclosure by an organization , the individual 
initiates a calculus process The risks of disclosure are evaluated, along with estimation of how much control the 
individual has over the disclosed information Based on the outcome of risk-control assessment, the individual 
deems the disclosure as acceptable or unacceptable If the disclosure is acceptable, the individual is not likely to 
perceive privacy intrusion and thus has lower level of privacy concerns As a consequence, a boundary opening 
follows and personal information is revealed In the case the disclosure is evaluated as unacceptable, the individual 
perceives this outcome as privacy intrusion Depending on the risk-control assessment, the perception of intrusion 
may give rise to privacy concerns Therefore, boundary closing may follow and the information is withheld Based 
on the IBT framework described above, below we define each construct in our model and present the hypotheses of 
the relationships among constructs 
 
    Research Model – Constructs and Nomological Network 
Privacy Concerns  
Prior research into privacy issues has focused on understanding what motivates Internet users to disclose personal 
information and what inhibits them from disclosing it Among various privacy related constructs examined in the 
literature, the construct of privacy concerns is one of the most widely used variable in the IS research and 
consistently shown to be one of the strongest predictors of privacy-related behavior  In addition, the concept of privacy concerns has been a viable part 
of the economical privacy models such as privacy calculus which treats individual privacy-related behavior as a 
result of a situational and context-specific cost-benefit analysis of information disclosure  Several pioneering privacy studies have attempted to 
conceptualize and operationalize privacy concerns in more detail: The Concern for Information Privacy  scale 
was developed by Smith, Milburg, and Burke  which identified four data-related dimensions of privacy 
concerns  that have since served as one of 
the most reliable instrument measuring individuals’ concerns toward organizational privacy practices Recently, 
Malhotra, Kim, and Agarwal  operationalized a multidimensional notion of Internet Users Information 
Privacy Concerns  which adapted the CFIP in the Internet context  
IS Security and Privacy 
   
 
In this study, we avoid repeating the numerous extant studies about the link between privacy concerns and behaviorrelated variables Instead, we focus on explaining how privacy concerns are formed Thus, the dependent variable of 
our research model is the construct of privacy concerns which is defined as concerns about possible loss of privacy 
as a result of information disclosure to an online business   
Perception of Intrusion 
The concept of intrusion has always been related to the concept of personal space , which particularly well matches with our IBT framework Based on a 
comprehensive review of scholarly work and courts’ interpretations of privacy and intrusion, Solove  defines 
intrusion as “invasive acts that disturb one’s tranquility or solitude”  and “involves the unwanted general 
incursion of another’s presence or activities”  Solove  further argues that intrusion disturbs the 
victim’s daily activities, alters her routines, destroys her solitude, and often makes her feel uncomfortable and 
uneasy Protection against intrusion involves protecting the individual from unwanted social invasions, affording 
people what Warren and Brandeis called “the right to be let alone”  According to Solove , 
intrusion can create discomfort and harm and requires protection even if the information is barely disseminated 
Thus, intrusion has always been identified as an event harmful to the individual, and with this, it bears negative 
connotation   
However, we argue that not every penetration of the personal space is deemed as harmful by the individual 
Examples of personal space’s boundaries penetrations that are not perceived or labeled as intrusion are abundant: 
 teams breaking in a house to save a person’s life from a health, fire, or crime threats; consented personal 
information and habit gathering to received special offers and coupons; sensitive medical information request to 
select the best medical treatment; installation of security monitoring systems in private spaces, etc Therefore, 
perception of boundary penetration and perception of intrusion are two different perceptions and the latter obviously 
involves a specific set of beliefs, to be perceived of causing harm and labeled as intrusion  
Intrusion was identified as a component of privacy by the tort scholar Prosser  who synthesized the cases that 
emerged from Warren and Brandeis’s famous law review article The Right to Privacy  Prosser categorized 
four types of harmful activities under the rubric of privacy, namely: ) Intrusion upon the plaintiff’s seclusion or 
solitude, or into his private affairs; ) Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff; ) Publicity 
which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye; ) Appropriation, for the defendant’s advantage, of the 
plaintiff’s name or like-ness Likewise, Westin  defined reserve as “the creation of a psychological barrier 
against unwanted intrusion” as a component of his four states of individual privacy And developed the Invasion of Privacy Score  that captures the perception of intrusion into the personal information 
space As one can see, intrusion can certainly raise privacy concerns, but intrusion is not the only condition that 
informs individual’s privacy concerns In other words, intrusion perception is not identical with privacy concerns 
The items , , and  from Rosser’s categorization above also inform privacy concerns but they can occur without 
any form of intrusion into the personal space Therefore, we conclude that perceived intrusion is a distinctly 
different construct from privacy concerns Seeing that perceived intrusion involves harmful incursion into the 
personal information space, we propose it as an important predictor to privacy concerns:  
H1: Perception of intrusion positively affects privacy concerns 
Determinants to Perception of Intrusion  
Prior research on information disclosure within the framework of IBT points to the following important components 
of boundary management: risk and control, personal and environmental factors According to the IBT and its 
adaptive form of Communications Privacy Management Theory , disclosure has both benefits and 
risks and thus involves a complex calculation and informed decision making about boundary opening or closure 
When people disclose or open their personal space to the others, they give over something they feel belongs to them 
and thus “they feel they should retain the right to control it and not be harmed, even after disclosure”  Disclosure renders people vulnerable to opportunistic exploitation because the disclosed private 
information becomes co-owned by other parties  As such, disclosure always involves some degree 
of risk  It is the risk that invokes the protective behavior of erecting boundaries that will separate 
what space/information we consider public and private Therefore, these boundaries become the core mechanism of 
 
Examining the Formation of Individual's Privacy Concerns 
 
 
   
 
controlling who and how much has access to the personal space/information  
Therefore, the boundary management rules are developed to help people maximize the benefits from disclosure 
while minimizing the risks As we mentioned above, these rules are situational and personality dependent and may 
change very dynamically The benefits include self-expression, to relationship development, to social control, while 
the risks include loss of dignity, status, control   
We propose that, when a boundary penetration has been detected by an individual, she develops a perception of 
intrusion into her personal space after the evaluation of risks and control involved in the penetration In other words, 
perceived risk and perceived control are major determinants of perception of intrusion The personal nature  of the boundary management rules and of the perception of intrusion are reflected in the individual’s 
cultural and personality characteristics which we call disposition to value privacy, much like the development of 
disposition to trust in the trust literature  Furthermore, the situational and environmental 
factors on which the boundary management rules develop are reflected in the “perception of the environment” 
through a set of organizational privacy assurance variables, much like the structure assurance in the trust literature 
 Below we describe these construct and their relationships with more details 
Perceived Privacy Risk  
Risk has been generally defined as uncertainty resulting from the potential for a negative outcome  and the possibility of the other party’s opportunistic behavior that can result in losses  Sources of opportunistic behavior with personal data include selling to, or sharing 
information with third parties, financial institutions  or government agencies  Privacy risk could also include the misuse of personal information, such as insider disclosure or 
unauthorized access and theft  A number of e-commerce studies empirically verified the negative 
effect of perceived risk on intentions to conduct transactions  Consistent with prior literature , we define perceived 
privacy risk as the expectation of losses associated with the disclosure of personal information online Early 
conceptual work has suggested that the potential negative consequences of information disclosure are related to 
perceived invasion of privacy  Therefore, the higher the 
perceived risk from a penetration into the personal information space, the higher the likelihood that it will be 
perceived as intrusion 
H2a Perceived privacy risk positively affects perceptions of intrusion 
Along the line of the theory of reasoned action  , privacy risk perception, viewed as the negative 
antecedent belief, is expected to affect a person’s attitude that is defined as a learned predisposition of human beings 
 Empirical studies in e-commerce generally supported this expectation of the negative 
relationship between risk perception and privacy concerns  
Accordingly, we expect that the same logic can be applied to our integrative framework 
H2b Perceived privacy risk positively affects privacy concerns 
Perceived Privacy Control  
The element of control is embedded in most privacy conceptual arguments and definitions and has been used to 
operationalize privacy in numerous measurement instruments  Privacy scholars have often linked the concept of privacy with control by 
either defining privacy as control per se, or positioning control as a key factor shaping privacy In this research, 
“control” – interpreted as perceived control over disclosure and subsequent use of personal information – is 
conceptualized as a related but separate variable from privacy concerns Such conceptualization has been supported 
by Laufer and Wolfe , who positioned control as a mediating variable in the privacy system by arguing that “a 
situation is not necessarily a privacy situation simply because the individual perceives, experiences, or exercises 
control”  Conversely, the individual may not perceive she has a control, yet the environmental and 
interpersonal elements may create perceptions of privacy  These considerations suggest 
that perceived privacy control is a separate construct from privacy concerns and that the two constructs are 
negatively related Empirical evidence revealed that control is one of the key factors which provide the greatest 
degree of explanation for privacy concern  In other words, 
IS Security and Privacy 
   
 
perceived control over disclosure and subsequent use of personal information is a contrary factor that is weighed 
against privacy concerns 
H3a Perceived privacy control negatively affects privacy concerns 
 
Prior literature has generally supported the relationship between perceived control and perceived privacy invasion 
 It has been found that individuals who perceived they had control over the use of the 
information to be disclosed, experienced less privacy invasion than did those who believed they had no control over 
their personal information  Culnan and Armstrong  also argue that individuals 
perceive information disclosure to be less privacy-invasive when they believe that they are able to control future use 
of the information Conversely, using personal information without permission is viewed as a privacy invasion and 
unethical behavior , which may result in angry and disloyal customers who are more 
likely to defect  Therefore, we hypothesize that: 
H3b Perceived privacy control negatively affects perceptions of intrusion 
Disposition to Value Privacy  
The IBT theory suggests that the privacy management of opening and closing the boundaries of the personal space 
and the resulted in disclosure or withholding of information is dependent on the individual’s personal characteristics 
In the trust literature, a similar construct reflecting the personal trusting tendencies has been identified and named 
propensity to trust  or disposition to trust  which has been shown to 
influence trusting beliefs in the literature Likewise, personal disposition to value privacy reflects the individual’s 
inherent needs and attitudes towards marinating a personal space Patil and Kobsa  define and measure the 
personal disposition towards privacy as how much individuals “value privacy”  and have 
found that it is a major determinant to privacy concerns Similarly, we define disposition to value privacy as the 
extent to which a person displays a willingness to preserve his or her private space or to disallow disclosure of 
personal information to others across a broad spectrum of situations and persons In the IBT framework, given that 
personal characteristics such as self-expression  determine the 
boundary opening/closure rules, we posit that disposition to value privacy, as a personal characteristics, affects 
directly the perception of intrusion, and indirectly, through the latter, privacy concerns Thus, given the same risk 
and control assessment of a certain personal space penetration or information gathering, an individual who has a 
higher value to privacy will perceive the penetration as intrusion, while an individual who tends to be more “open” 
and more likely to share “his or her space or information”, will not perceive the same penetration as intrusion 
Additionally, given the same type of privacy penetration, an individual with greater disposition to value privacy will 
perceive higher risk of and lower control over his or her personal space and information Therefore, we hypothesize: 
H4a Disposition to value privacy positively affects perception of intrusion 
H4b Disposition to value privacy positively affects perceived privacy risk 
H4c Disposition to value privacy negatively affects perceived privacy control 
We consider two subconstructs to disposition to value privacy, namely privacy awareness and privacy social norms 
Both have been related to the individual’s innate characteristics of privacy in the literature and both have been 
shown to be important factors 
Privacy Awareness 
Privacy awareness reflects the extent to which an individual is informed about privacy practices and policies, about 
how disclosed information is used, and is cognizant about their impact over the individual’s ability to preserve her 
private space  Dinev and 
Hart  developed social awareness as a predictor to privacy concerns According to them, individuals with 
high social  awareness will in general closely follow privacy issues, the possible consequences of a loss of 
privacy due to accidental, malicious, or intentional leakage of personal information, and the development of privacy 
policies Media news and highly publicized cases will heighten their acquaintance with possible breaches of privacy 
and security, and the risks These individuals will have a stronger awareness and will appreciate more the 
importance of privacy in social life Therefore, privacy awareness is an antecedent to the personal disposition to 
 
Examining the Formation of Individual's Privacy Concerns 
 
 
   
 
value privacy, which in our model is the very factor that reflects the personal characteristics of the privacy 
management and information disclosure, per IBT: 
H5 Privacy awareness positively affects disposition to value privacy 
Privacy Social Norm 
As Laufer and Wolfe  argue, the “mores of a community transmitted through language, tradition, and values 
constitute boundaries of consciousness about privacy”  Patterns and forms of privacy has long been related to 
the cultural characteristics of the social group an individual lives in  
Several MIS studies have found that there are differences in information privacy concerns across cultures , the cultural dimension of individualism 
 being the most responsible factor for these differences The concept of privacy is 
related to the extent that individualism is sought after and reinforced in a culture  In the US, a highly 
individualistic society, legal precedent and public opinion highly value privacy as an expression and a safeguard of 
personal dignity  and individual right  Additionally, per IBT, 
the perception of space is also associated with the notion of privacy  What is 
private versus public space, as well as how much physical distance between people is considered normal are all 
distinct characteristics of cultures, and all are related to perceptions of privacy  We posit that, 
the social norm about privacy determines an individual’s disposition to value privacy and thus influences the 
boundary management in the IBT framework: 
H6 Privacy social norm positively affects disposition to value privacy  
Institutional Privacy Assurance 
Situational and environmental factors influence information boundary management rules  Institutional assurance is 
a salient environmental factor that influences information boundary opening or closing  Institutional assurance with 
respect to privacy concerns is similar to the assurance components of models focusing on trust  In the latter the 
assurance components are the institutional dimensions of trust   In our model focusing on 
privacy, the assurance components are the institutional dimensions of risk and control and represent the 
environmental factors that influence information boundary management decisions Following the integrative trust 
formation model developed by , we define institutional privacy assurance as the 
interventions that a particular company makes to ensure consumers that efforts have been devoted to protect 
personal information These interventions assure consumers that, in terms of information privacy, this company is 
safe This study focuses two types of interventions:  company privacy policy and  industry self-regulation  
The need for institutional privacy assurances is predicated on the assumption that companies have an incentive to 
address privacy concerns because if they fail to do so they will suffer reputational losses Institutional assurances are 
mechanisms ensuring consumers that when they disclose personal information it will be held in a protective domain 
wherein the company becomes a co-owner of the information and accepts responsibility for keeping the information 
safe and private  The result is that companies are responsible for protecting the information by 
implementing privacy policies based on fair information practices   
The privacy literature suggests that a firm’s collection of personal information is perceived to be fair when the 
consumer is vested with notice and voice  In other words, consumers 
want to influence changes in firms’ polices that they find to be objectionable  Privacy policy 
is a mechanism where consumers can be informed about the choices available to them regarding how the collected 
information is used, the safeguards in place to protect the information from loss, misuse, or alteration, and how 
consumers can update or correct any inaccurate information The prescription of notification of and consent by 
consumers effectively exemplifies procedural fairness and thus increases consumers’ perceived control over their 
personal information  Therefore: 
H7a: The perceived effectiveness of privacy policy increases consumers’ perceived privacy control 
Interestingly, Culnan and Armstrong  found that for individuals who were informed about information 
handling procedures by an organization, privacy concerns did not distinguish individuals who were willing from 
those who were unwilling to have personal information used for marketing analysis In other words, privacy risks 
IS Security and Privacy 
   
 
washed out with the presence of a privacy policy Previous studies have also shown that businesses that inform 
consumers about information handling procedures instill greater perceptions of confidence and procedural fairness, 
thereby lowering consumers’ perceived risks of personal information disclosure  
Therefore, we hypothesize:    
H7b: The perceived effectiveness of privacy policy reduces consumers’ perceived privacy risk 
Frequently, institutional privacy assurance is reinforced by the industry self-regulatory initiatives  These involve 
standards established by an industry group or certifying agency which are then voluntarily adopted by industry 
members or associates  Under this self-regulatory approach, industries develop rules and 
enforcement procedures that substitute for government regulation  and often issue certifications in the 
form of seals of approvals which assure that the businesses indeed conform to the fair information practices they 
purport to  The private sector approach to information privacy regulation consists of 
industry codes of conduct and the use of self-policing trade groups and associations to regulate information privacy  
An examples of an industry self-regulator is the Direct Marketing Association  that made compliance with its 
privacy principles as a condition of membership  Other examples include privacy seals on e-commerce 
and e-service web sites such as those given by Online Privacy Alliance or TRUSTe, and whose effectiveness has 
been examined in prior MIS studies  In this situation, consumers and businesses 
collectively control personal information, with the industry self regulator acting as a facilitator for resolving any 
conflicts that may arise  Studies have shown that companies that announce membership in self-regulating 
trade groups or associations foster consumers’ perceptions of control over their personal information  and mitigate consumers’ perceived privacy risks in disclosing personal information  Therefore, we hypothesize:   
H8a: The perceived effectiveness of industry self-regulation increases consumers’ perceived privacy 
control 
H8b: The perceived effectiveness of industry self-regulation reduces consumers’ perceived privacy risk 
Method 
Scale Development 
The research hypotheses were empirically tested using data collected with a survey that included items for the 
constructs specified in the model Scale development for the constructs was based on an extensive survey of the 
privacy literature Validated standard scales were adapted for use as far as possible Privacy concerns were measured 
by seven-point Likert scale items that were directly taken from the measurement of concern for information privacy 
 outlined in : collection of personal information, unauthorized secondary use of personal 
information, errors in personal information, and improper access to personal information However, wordings were 
adapted to capture perceptions of a specific web site’s privacy practices In our search for rigorously validated 
empirical measures for perception of intrusion, we explored the literature in social sciences, political economy, 
sociology, and organizational sciences, and contacted leading researchers in these fields We were not able to find 
any previously developed and rigorously validated instruments that measure perception of intrusion as a separate 
construct In previous studies, perceptions of intrusion items were included in general privacy-related instruments 
 Consistent with the current best practices in scale development, we relied 
on theoretical developments of the construct and its meaning ; and we 
cast a wide net in identifying candidate items We constructed an initial set of items reflecting the underlying theory 
while observing the trends in general survey research   
We measured perceived privacy risks using four seven-point Likert scale items that were adopted in Dinev and Hart 
 and to reflect the potential losses associated with the information disclosure 
Perceived privacy control was  measured using four questions The measurement 
items for perceived effectiveness of privacy policy and industry self-regulation were developed based on 
institutional trust literature  in which the conceptualization of institution-based trust 
matches our operationalization of institutional privacy assurance We used TRUSTe as an example of privacy seal in 
the context of Internet Disposition to value privacy was measured by three questions that were directly taken from 
 Awareness to privacy was measured by three questions that were directly taken from Dinev

and Hart  Drawing on technology adoption literature , social norm was measured with 
three questions that addressed the importance of social influence on individual privacy perceptions  
Survey Administration 
The initial questionnaire was reviewed by four Information Systems  faculty members for clarity Next, a pilot 
study involving  undergraduate students was conducted using the improved questionnaire The main objectives of 
the pilot study were to assess the clarity and conciseness of the survey instructions and questions, evaluate the 
measurement model, and gauge the duration of the survey The respondents were also contacted for a face-to-face 
interview so that their opinions on the survey instructions and questions could be gathered Following their feedback 
and analysis of measurement model, a number of revisions were made: some items were dropped, wording changes 
were made, and instructions that the respondents found confusing were clarified All measurement items were 
included in Appendix A  
Due to the context-specific nature of privacy , parameter estimates in the model  may not necessarily be the same among different contexts As such, the final survey was 
administered to users of four different types of web sites: ) electronic commerce sites, ) social networking sites, ) 
financial sites, and ) healthcare sites Each participant was randomly assigned to one of the four Internet usage 
contexts The final survey was administered to undergraduate, graduate and MBA students at three large universities 
in the United States Participants were asked to recall their experiences in using one website of the assigned context 
They were also asked to list the name or URL of the assigned context within last  months The responses from 
those participants who never used any website of assigned context were dropped from data analysis There were 
 subjects participated;  responses were usable  
Data Analysis and Results 
Partial least squares , a second-generation causal modeling statistical technique, was used for data analysis 
PLS possesses many advantages over traditional statistical methods such as factor analysis, MANOVA and 
regression First, PLS is well suited for highly complex predictive models  This makes PLS suitable 
for handling large number of constructs Second, PLS has the ability to assess the measurement model within the 
context of the structural model, which allows a more complete analysis of inter-relationships in the model Third, 
PLS is generally more appropriate for testing theories in the early stages of development  Given the large number of constructs being tested as well as the exploratory nature of this study in the early 
stage of theoretical development, PLS is more suitable than other methods 
Measurement Model 
We evaluated the measurement model by examining the convergent validity and discriminant validity of the 
research instrument Convergent validity is the degree to which different attempts to measure the same construct 
agree  In PLS, three tests are used to determine the convergent validity of measured 
reflective constructs in a single instrument: reliability of items, composite reliability of constructs, and average 
variance extracted by constructs Appendix A presents the assessment of the measurement model We assessed item 
reliability by examining the loading of each item on the construct, and found the reliability score for all the items 
exceeded the criterion of  Thus, the questions measuring each construct in our experiment had adequate item 
reliability Composite reliabilities of constructs with multiple indicators exceeded Nunnally’s  criterion of  
The average variances extracted for the constructs were all above  percent, and the Cronbach’s alphas were also 
all higher than  These results support the convergent validity of the measurement model   
Discriminant validity is the degree to which measures of different constructs are distinct  
To test discriminant validity, the square root of the variance shared between a construct and its measures should be 
greater than the correlations between the construct and any other construct in the model Table  reports the results 
of discriminant validity which may be seen by comparing the diagonal to the non-diagonal elements All items in 
our study fulfilled the requirement of discriminant validity

Structural Model 
After establishing the validity of the measures, we tested the structural paths in the research model using PLS We 
split the dataset into four subsets according to the type of contexts and the structural models were tested separately 
for four different types of websites We conducted hypothesis tests by examining the sign and significance of the 
path coefficients A bootstrapping technique was applied to estimate the significance of the path coefficients Since 
PLS does not generate any overall goodness of fit indices, predictive validity is assessed primarily through an 
examination of the explanatory power and significance of the hypothesized paths The explanatory power of the 
structural model is assessed based on the amount of variance explained in the endogenous construct  We conducted the statistical tests at a five-percent level of significance using one-tailed t-tests  
Table  presents the structural models for four different contexts The structural models explain %, %, % and 
%, of the variance in privacy concerns in the contexts of e-commerce, social networking, finance and healthcare 
respectively  As shown in Table , for all the four contexts, the direct effect of perception of intrusion, privacy risk, 
and privacy control are significant, thus supporting H1, H2b, and H3a, respectively As hypothesized, privacy risk 
and privacy control strongly influence perception of intrusion, thus validating H2a and H3b Disposition to privacy 
and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy are found to have significant impacts on reducing privacy risks, 
validating H4b and H7b Privacy social norm is a significant predictor of disposition to value privacy Perceived effectiveness of privacy policy strongly influences privacy control, validating H7a

However, perceived effectiveness of privacy  does not have any significant impact on perceived privacy risk  
For the hypothesis on the relationship between disposition to value privacy and perception of instruction , it is 
not significant for the healthcare context but significant for the rest contexts Regarding the impact of disposition to 
value privacy on privacy control , it is significant for the social networking context but this is not the case for 
the rest three contexts Privacy awareness has been found to be a significant predictor of disposition to value privacy 
 in the e-commerce, finance and healthcare contexts but such relationship is not supported in the social 
networking context For the hypothesis on the relationship between perceived effectiveness of privacy seal and 
privacy control , it is not significant for the finance context but significant for the rest of contexts  
Discussion and Conclusion 
Discussion of Findings 
This study developed and empirically tested an integrative model to investigate the formation process of privacy 
concerns Our proposed model is able to account for % ~ % of the variance in privacy concerns across different 
Internet usage context, which possesses enough explanatory power to make the interpretation of path coefficients 
meaningful The evidence from this study provided empirical support that privacy concerns form because of an 
individual’s disposition to value privacy or situational cues that enable one person to assess the consequences of 
information disclosure A cognitive process of assessing the information boundary, comprising privacy risk, privacy 
control and privacy intrusion, is shown important to shape an individual’s privacy concerns towards a specific Web 
site’s privacy practices   
More than previous empirical privacy studies, this research shows that privacy constructs relate to each other in 
organized, meaningful ways This is important because definitions of privacy and relationships among privacyrelated constructs are inconsistent and not fully developed or empirically validated in current literature Having an 
integrative research framework with consistent set of constructs should enable privacy research to progress more 
quickly by having systematic understandings  
The findings empirically validate the cognitive process of privacy concerns Perception of instruction, perceived 
privacy risk and perceived privacy control are shown to be important in affecting privacy concerns across different 
context in e-commerce, social networking, finance and healthcare The results also show that individuals’ control 
perceptions over their personal information could help reduce their perceptions of intrusion; and their privacy risk 
perceptions significantly lead to perceptions of intrusion For all the four Internet usage contexts, disposition to 
value privacy is shown to be an important predictor of perceived privacy risk; and privacy social norm is found to be 
a significant predictor of disposition to value privacy Furthermore, this study shows that the organizational privacy 
assurance intervention through privacy policy could increase individuals’ perceived privacy control and mitigate 
their privacy risk perceptions across different contexts         
However, the proposed organizational intervention through privacy seals did not have a direct impact on perceived 
privacy risk in any of the four contexts  One plausible explanation for this unexpected finding is that the 
participants did not trust these privacy seals provided by third parties, and hence their privacy risk perceptions were 
not affected by the privacy seals This finding is not surprising as prior studies have shown the weak effects of 
privacy seals on mitigating privacy risks  In fact, Edelman  recently found that TRUSTecertified sites are more than twice as likely to be untrustworthy as uncertified sites Hence, privacy interventions 
involving a third party appear less effective than those interventions directly from web sites   
This result suggests that there is indeed a business incentive for websites to focus more on enhancing their privacy 
policies 
The insignificant effect of industry self-regulation  on privacy risk 
prompts a question about the role it plays in alleviating privacy concerns The results show that, although privacy 
seals were ineffective in mitigating privacy risk, it did enhance individuals’ privacy control perceptions for the usage 
of e-commerce, social networking, and healthcare sites Hence, it seems that privacy seals can only influence 
perception of intrusion and privacy concerns indirectly through the privacy control  However, such effect of privacy 
seals cannot be applied to the usage of financial sites Our result showed that perceived effectiveness of privacy 
seals did not affect privacy control perception for the finance context  There is perhaps nothing surprising in 
this finding since the finance industry has its own standards and more strict government regulations for protecting 
IS Security and Privacy 
customers’ financial information Thus, it seems that the market for privacy seals in the financial sector is very 
limited In fact, none of the finance sites used by our participants has a privacy seal 
Another context-specific difference in the hypothesized relationships is the lack of statistical significance for the 
path between disposition to value privacy and perception of intrusion  in the healthcare context Perhaps many 
individuals who use healthcare sites have urgent needs and want to benefit from information they can acquire 
through them  They understand that submitting detailed personal information is required in order to obtain precise 
and accurate medical information or services  They may feel that they have to adjust their privacy p and 
disposition which might otherwise lead them to withhold information submission in other contexts  An adjustment 
would reflect an evaluation of the risk and control factors in the privacy calculus that would result in a different 
information boundary decision than the one an individual might make in other contexts    
As for the relationship between DTVP and perceived privacy control , the results show that it was statistically 
significant only for the social networking context In addition, the context of social networking differs from the other 
three in another hypothesized relationship For the effect of privacy awareness on DTVP , it was insignificant 
for the social networking context but significant for the other three Regarding such interesting pattern of results for 
the social networking context, a plausible explanation is that these results may to some degree be a function of 
extensive media exposure in the weeks prior to the administration of our survey  In early , there was a privacy 
outcry regarding news feed features and the web beacon at social networking sites   Thus, 
users of social networking sites may well have been more aware of privacy issues associated with such sites, which 
leads to the insignificant relationship between privacy awareness and DTVP  In addition, social networking 
companies have been rolling out features that allow users to control who can access their personal information 
Some social networking sites  even embedded the privacy control features into the very use of 
various social networking functions and thus integrated privacy control as part of social networking functionality 
Accordingly, it is perhaps not surprising to see that our respondents from the social networking context had a 
significantly higher mean of perceived privacy control  than the respondents from the other contexts  These interesting results indicate that there 
is possibly a set of other factors that are unique for the users of the social networking sites but probably less 
important for the other three contexts Future research could be directed to further explore the social networking 
context  
Implication and Conclusion 
Our research model is strongly rooted in a general conceptual framework drawing on IBT and our model is likely to 
be applicable to a variety of privacy-related contexts Our posited predictors explain % ~ % of the variance in 
the construct of privacy concerns in different context, suggesting that the IBT serves as a useful theoretical 
foundation in the information privacy context Additionally, the present study highlights the roles of personal 
characteristics and organizational interventions in increasing privacy control and mitigating privacy risk, which have 
important implications for the Web vendors in diverse sectors  
From a practical perspective, this study shows that a privacy cognitive process involving calculating privacy risk and 
control perceptions as well as perception of invasion are the important factors in determining the level of privacy 
concerns toward a specific website’s information practices In this aspect, this study provides some insights into the 
different approaches that could be employed by a website First, this study shows that incorporating organizational 
privacy structural assurances through privacy policy is one of the important ways of increasing individuals’ privacy 
control perceptions and reducing their privacy risk perceptions Second, although organizational intervention 
through privacy seals could enhance individuals’ privacy control perceptions , such involvement with a third party is less effective in reducing individuals’ privacy risk perceptions Thus, 
there is indeed a business incentive for websites to focus more on enhancing their privacy policies and 
communicating them to their customers 
In conclusion, this study provides preliminary empirical support to understand the formation of privacy concerns 
from the information boundary theory perspective Using the groundwork laid down in this study, future research 
along various possible directions could contribute significantly to extending our theoretical understanding and 
practical ability to tackle the Internet privacy issues
